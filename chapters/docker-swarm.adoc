## Deploy Application on Docker Swarm Cluster

Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It allows you create and access to a pool of Docker hosts using the full suite of Docker tools. Because Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.

### Key Components of Docker Swarm

.Key Components of Docker Swarm
image::docker-swarm-components.png[]

*Swarm Manager*: Docker Swarm has a Manager, that is a pre-defined Docker Host, and is a single point for all administration. Swarm manager orchestrates and schedules containers on the entire cluster. Swarm Manager can be configured in https://docs.docker.com/swarm/multi-manager-setup/[High Availability].

*Swarm Nodes*: The containers are deployed on Nodes that are additional Docker Hosts. Each Swarm Node must be accessible by the manager, each node must listen to the same network interface (TCP port). Each node runs a Docker Swarm agent that registers the referenced Docker daemon, monitors it, and updates the discovery backend with the node’s status. The containers run on a node.

*Scheduler Strategy*: Different scheduler strategies ("`binpack`", "`spread`" (default), and "`random`") can be applied to pick the best node to run your container. The default strategy optimizes the node for least number of running containers. There are multiple kinds of filters, such as constraints and affinity.  This should allow for a decent scheduling algorithm.

*Node Discovery Service*: Swarm manager talks to a hosted discovery service. This service maintains a list of IPs in Swarm cluster. Docker Hub hosts a discovery service that can be used during development. In production, this is replaced by other services such as `etcd`, `consul`, or `zookeeper`. You can even use a static file. This is particularly useful if there is no access to Internet, or you are running the setup in a closed network.

**Standard Docker API:** Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API and thus any tool that talks to a single Docker host will seamlessly scale to multiple hosts now. That means that if you were using shell scripts using Docker CLI to configure multiple Docker hosts, the same CLI would can now talk to Swarm cluster.

There are a lots of other concepts but these are the main ones.

### Create Discovery Service

### Create Docker Swarm Cluster

Swarm is fully integrated with Machine, and so is the easiest way to get started.

. Create a Swarm Master and point to the Consul discovery service:

To see how to connect Docker to this machine, run: docker-machine env swarm-master
----
+
Few options to look here:
+
.. `--swarm` configures the Machine with Swarm
.. `--swarm-master` configures the created Machine to be Swarm master
.. `--swarm-discovery` defines address of the discovery service
.. `--cluster-advertise` advertise the machine on the network
.. `--cluster-store` designate a distributed k/v storage backend for the cluster
.. `--virtualbox-disk-size` sets the disk size for the created Machine to 5GB. This is required so that WildFly and Couchbase image can be downloaded on any of the nodes.
+
. Find some information about this machine:
+
[source, json]
----
docker-machine inspect --format='{{json .Driver}}'  swarm-master
{"Boot2DockerImportVM":"","Boot2DockerURL":"","CPU":1,"DiskSize":5000,"HostOnlyCIDR":"192.168.99.1/24","HostOnlyNicType":"82540EM","HostOnlyPromiscMode":"deny","IPAddress":"192.168.99.102","MachineName":"swarm-master","Memory":1024,"NoShare":false,"SSHPort":51972,"SSHUser":"docker","StorePath":"/Users/arungupta/.docker/machine","SwarmDiscovery":"consul://192.168.99.100:8500","SwarmHost":"tcp://0.0.0.0:3376","SwarmMaster":true,"VBoxManager":{}}
----
+
Note that the disk size is 5GB.
+
. Connecting to the master by using the command:
+
  eval "$(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)"
+
NOTE: If you're on Windows, use the `docker-machine env swarm-master` command only and copy the output into an editor to replace all appearances of EXPORT with SET and issue the three commands at your command prompt, remove the quotes and all duplicate appearences of "/".

The machines that are part of the cluster have cluster’s name in the SWARM column, blank otherwise. For example, `consul-machine` is a standalone machine where as all other machines are part of the `swarm-master` cluster. The Swarm master is also identified by (master) in the SWARM column.

. Connect to the Swarm cluster and find some information about it:

  eval "$(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)"
  docker info

Note, `--swarm` is specified to connect to the Swarm cluster. Otherwise the command will connect to `swarm-master` Machine only.

### Deploy Application to Docker Swarm Cluster

The cluster is now ready and we need to deploy our application to it. 

This application will provide a CRUD/REST interface on a data bucket in Couchbase. This is achieved by using a Java EE application deployed on WildFly and accessing the database. Follow the steps to deploy and access the application:

. Start application environment using Docker Compose (WildFly and Couchbase)
. Configure Couchbase server and install `travel-sample` bucket
. Deploy the application

Swarm takes care of distribution of deployments across the nodes.

#### Start Application Environment Using Docker Compose

Make sure you are connected to the cluster by giving the command `eval "$(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)"`.

. List all the networks created by Docker so far:

Docker create three networks for each host automatically:
+
[options="header", cols="1,3", width="80%"]
|====
| Network Name | Purpose
| `bridge` | Default network that containers connect to. This is `docker0` network in all Docker installations.
| `none` | Container-specific networking stack
| `host` | Adds a container on hosts networking stack. Network configuration is identical to the host.
|====
+
This explains a total of nine networks, three for each node, as shown in this Swarm cluster.
+
. Use Compose file to start WildFly and Couchbase:

  environment:

  ports:

----
+
In this Compose file:
+
.. Couchbase service has a custom container name defined by `container_name`. This name is used when creating a new environment variable `COUCHBASE_URI` during WildFly startup.
.. `arungupta/wildfly-admin` image is used as it binds WildFly’s management to all network interfaces, and in addition also exposes port 9990. This enables WildFly Maven Plugin to be used to deploy the application.

As seen, `wildflycouchbasejavaee7` overlay network exists on all Machines. This confirms that the overlay network created for Swarm cluster was added to each host in the cluster. `docker_gwbridge` only exists on Machines that have application containers running.

Note that Couchbase server is running on `swarm-master` node and WildFly is running on `swarm-node-01`.

#### Configure Couchbase server

. Clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/couchbase-javaee.git. This workspace contains a simple Java EE application that is deployed on WildFly and provides a REST API over `travel-sample` bucket in Couchbase.
. Couchbase server can be configured using http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.0/rest-api/rest-endpoints-all.html[REST API]. The application contains a Maven profile that allows to configure Couchbase server with `travel-sample` bucket. This can be invoked as:
+
[source, text]
----
mvn install -Pcouchbase -Ddocker.host=$(docker-machine ip swarm-master)

. . .

* Server auth using Basic with user 'Administrator'
> POST /sampleBuckets/install HTTP/1.1
> Authorization: Basic QWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjpwYXNzd29yZA==

#### Deploy Application

Deploy the application to WildFly by specifying three parameters:

. Host IP address where WildFly is running
. Username of a user in WildFly's administrative realm
. Password of the user specified in WildFly's administrative realm

#### Access Application

Now that WildFly and Couchbase server have started, lets access the application. You need to specify IP address of the Machine where WildFly is running:
